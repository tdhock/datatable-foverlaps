Overlap Death Match!

Intersect/overlap of genomic data (possibly from bed/bedGraph files)
is implemented by

- [[https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table][data.table::foverlaps]] in R.
- [[http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GenomicRanges.html][GenomicRanges::findOverlaps]] in R.
- [[https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2][bedtools intersect]] command line program.

** Demonstration

See [[demo.Rterm]] for the terminal output during my talk.

** Which is fastest? 

Recent versions of these packages are all pretty fast, see [[file:HOCKING-datatable-foverlaps.pdf][slides]] for
details. The only big winner is =data.table::fread=, 
which is much faster than =read.table= or =rtracklayer::import= for reading big bed/bedGraph files.

** Do they all give the same results? 

They all give the correct results, if used correctly. The only issue
is that [[http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQtracks.html#tracks1][chromStart is 0-based and chromEnd is 1-based in bedGraph
files]], so you need to use chromStart+1 to get correct results in
R. More specifically, if you read a bed file into R as a data.frame
with columns chrom, chromStart, chromEnd, you need to use
=IRanges(chromStart+1L, chromEnd)= or
=data.table(chromStart=chromStart+1L, chromEnd)= as input to
findOverlaps/foverlaps.

** How to reproduce these results?

The bedGraph files are big so I did not put them online anywhere,
which makes it impossible to re-do the timings in TF.benchmark.RData.

However a subset of the data is available:
