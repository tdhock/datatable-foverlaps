Overlap Death Match!

Intersect/overlap of genomic data (possibly from bed/bedGraph files)
is implemented by

- [[https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table][data.table::foverlaps]] in R.
- [[http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GenomicRanges.html][GenomicRanges::findOverlaps]] in R.
- [[https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2][bedtools intersect]] command line program.

Which of these packages is fastest?

Do they all give the same results?
